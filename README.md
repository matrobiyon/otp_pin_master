## How to integrate into your app?
Integrating the project is simple. All you need to do is follow the below steps

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file. Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```java
allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
  }
}
```
Step 2. Add the dependency
```java
dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.matrobiyon:otp_pin_master:1.1.1'
}
```

## How do you use the library in a simple way?
It appears that you have successfully integrated the library into your project, but what is the process for using it? Well, it's actually quite simple.
- Add the view in your xml file like

  ```
  <tj.otp.pin.master.OTPinMaster
        android:id="@+id/otp_pin_view"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        app:circleColor="#FFD470"
        app:activeRectangleColor="#FFD470"
        app:isPin="true"
        app:rectangleCount="5"
        app:rectangleWidth="65dp" 
  />
  ```
  In your code, create a variable and store the value of otp_pin_view in it.
  ```kotlin
  val otpPinView = findViewById<OTPinMaster>(R.id.otp__pin_view)
  ```
  or with binding
  ```
  val otpPinView = binding.otpPinView
  ```
  and set listener to it
  ```
  otpPinView.setOnDoneListener { result ->
    //Here should be your logic
  
    /*Check if result is correct
        otp.setIsCorrect(true)
                or
        otp.setIsCorrect(false)
     */
  }
  ```
  That's it. Congratulations ðŸ¥³
